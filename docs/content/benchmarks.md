# Benchmarks

Below you will see a list of common image decoders compared against Pfim.
You'll consistently find that Pfim is one of the fastest, if not the fastest
for every category. Even if Pfim doesn't win speed all the time, it wins when
it comes to ease of use (I know, I had to create these benchmarks!). These
benchmarks are always up-to-date as they are generated when a new release of
Pfim is.
